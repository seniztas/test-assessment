The Pet Clinic
--------------

### Background information

Mendix has a customer, *PetVets Inc. – a Pet Clinic*, that uses Mendix to create
and maintain an online booking system for their customers. You are working as a
member of the Mendix Expert Services team. *PetVets Inc.* contacted Mendix to
help them with this specific customer, because they are struggling with
development. Your assignment is to consult with the PetVets Inc. development
team to make the PetVets app fly.

Last year they released the following:

-   Website with calendar to make appointments

-   Availability overview of employees, rooms and equipment.

-   Customers can consult this overview as well

-   Email, SMS and Slack reminders for customers and Employees when an
    appointment is made.

-   Online payments with PayPal

-   Overview of the customers (CRM)



**The PetVets Inc. Scrum Team**

The development team consists of a single scrum team with 5 developers, 1 Test
engineer and a Product Owner. The team has faced some tough luck last year and
the motivation level is below zero.

During the Retrospective the team states they have lost confidence in the
product. There are bugs in the product that show a lack of testing by both
developers and testers. Besides that, there are very unclear requirements, and the
Product Owner has a hard time satisfying the stakeholders, who keep pressing
him.

The last two releases had to be rolled back, because of unpredicted behavior of
the product.

The team thinks that the stakeholders demand too much and are unreasonable with
deadlines. The result is a poor quality product and a decrease in motivation in
the team.

### Exercise description

The team is willing to give it a one last try. Their goal is to restore faith in
the product and the quality they deliver. You are asked to join the team as
second Test Engineer. You will join the team for at least a month and will be part
of the team for the next two sprints. The duration of a sprint is two weeks.

For the next sprint planning, the following 6 stories are on top of the Product
Backlog and are within the average velocity of the team. Before you start, the
development team provides with these stories, so you can prepare and give some
feedback in advance. Before the sprint starts you will have a meeting with the
team.

### Exercise 1: Prepare the Sprint

PetVets Inc has scheduled a pre-sprint team meeting. During this meeting you are
expected to share your thoughts and suggestions on the current situation of the
team and on how to approach the upcoming sprint(s).

Try to be concise but complete. Pay attention to:

-   What were your findings from reviewing/inspecting the stories?

-   What would you ask from the Product Owner/Dev Team?

-   Where do you see yourself and the other Test Engineer in the process?

-   How will you interact with the team during the sprint?


### Exercise 2: Expand test coverage

You are tasked with expanding and improving the test coverage of IAmDb; a Python application that implements a basic REST API that provides access to movie information. You can find the source code for IAmDb in the folder `iamdb`. This product is entirely stand-alone, and should be treated as such. E.g. all references in the code to the 'root folder' refer to `test-assessment/iamdb/`. 

In the `test` folder, you will find the outline of a test suite for the IAmDb API. Based on the resources provided in the application folder, expand that test suite to cover all the existing functionality. You should treat the suite as if it were production code, applying all the standards you would if you were working in a professional team of developers. 

Feel free to change, update, and expand the test suite in any way you see fit. It should be obvious that, at the very least, the scripts need to be fleshed out. However, improvements to the structure and the test framework itself are also perfectly acceptable. 

You are also more than welcome to peruse the source code of the API itself. However, be warned that the application is still being developed. You may assume the backend will drastically increase in size and complexity. Your test suite should be engineered with this in mind. 

To gather insight in your process, we would prefer you submit your assessment as a git repository. However, if you are not familiar with git, your submission will still be accepted if you ignore the git instructions below.

Before you get started, run `git init` inside the `iamdb` folder. All your changes should be committed to the resulting repository and the `.git` folder should be included when you submit your results. Again, IAmDb should be considered production code for the purposes of this assessment, which includes your git history. Furthermore; this assessment should be considered confidential information, so please do _not_ upload your repository to a remote git server, such as GitHub. 

While developing the test suite, pay attention to:

- Code quality. Your code should strive to be self-explanatory, with clear variable names, transparent structure, and a minimum of duplication. 

- Test scope. Make sure everything that needs to be tested is tested, while minimizing redundancy. 

- Test structure. Each test in the script should be maintainable, easy to find, transparant in its execution, and have a clear (useful) goal. 

Upon completion, please mail the `iamdb` folder to your contact for this interview process. 


#### Tooling
If your current IDE does not support Python, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a relatively light-weight option. Make sure to install the recommended Python extensions if you wish to exploit the Python linter. 

The instructions for the application assume the user has a Unix-based terminal. We recommend you either complete this section of the assessment on a Mac or Linux device, or install a terminal that mocks the Unix command line on Windows. A decent example is Git Bash, which ships with the [standard Windows Git install](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
